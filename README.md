# Rock The Vote

A lightweight javascript re-write of the original [RockTheVotePlugin](https://github.com/mayli/RockTheVotePlugin) updated to run on V7 servers.

## Installing

Simply download the zip file, pull the folder inside of it out, and put it into your config/mods folder.
(A server restart is required to update mods/plugins on your server.)

## Disclaimer

I am not claiming ownership of this plugin, original credit goes to [mayli](https://github.com/mayli) who made it first. It doesn't seem like it is being supported anymore and I rely on it for my own server, so I decided to update it myself.

There were some listed Todo's on the original plugin that I may get to later since I think they would be nice features, or if you want, feel free to create a pull request on this repo.

Please create a new issue if you find any bugs, I'm happy to try and fix them.
